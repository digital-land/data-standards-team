These principles are for the community of people that create and contribute to the work on the Digital Land project run by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (DLUHC).

## 1. Start with what exists

Reuse as much as possible and iterate based on user needs.

Start by checking which [datasets](https://www.planning.data.gov.uk/dataset/) already exist.

If you think something is missing, check the [list of discussions on GitHub](https://github.com/digital-land/data-standards-backlog/discussions) first, and then open a discussion if you still can’t find what you’re looking for.

## 2. Contribute back and help others

Anyone can contribute evidenced-based changes or open discussions. Share research findings and examples with others. Be open to feedback or changes to your work.

Above all, be kind. Encourage others to contribute by being respectful when asking questions or giving feedback.

## 3. Prioritise openness and honesty

Prioritise sharing your thoughts in the [list of discussions on GitHub](https://github.com/digital-land/data-standards-backlog/discussions). This makes them easier to find and reduces duplication of effort.

Be honest about the amount and nature of your research and findings. Share what works and what does not.

Promote awareness of existing work whenever possible.
