### Why are we looking at it

The Government’s national planning policy framework includes commitments to deliver enough sites of a high quality to support the Gypsy and Traveller communities. To know whether it is achieving it's intend goal the government needs to track the demand, location of that demand and whether local supply is able to meet that demand.

We think data can help governments at a local and national level achieve their goals.

### What we’ve done

We have worked closely to understand the sorts of questions the policy teams in DLUHC would like to answer. This gives us a set of user or data needs to work with.

Using those we have drafted [an initial data model](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNIiMA2Y=/) that we think would satisfy the needs.

### Whats next

We first need to test the data model with the policy teams to check it gives them the necessary data for them to answer their initial questions. Then we'd like to work with a small number of local planning authorities to check whether this is data they can publish and if they think there is any other data that would be worth including in the standard too.
